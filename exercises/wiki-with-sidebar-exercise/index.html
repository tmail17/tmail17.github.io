                <h1>Milky Way (chocolate bar)</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Milky Way is a brand of chocolate-covered confectionery bar 
                    manufactured and marketed by Mars Inc. There are two 
                    varieties: the U.S. Milky Way bar and the global Milky Way 
                    bar.

                   The Milky Way bar is made of nougat, topped with caramel and 
                   covered with milk chocolate. It was created in 1923 by Frank 
                   C. Mars and originally manufactured in Minneapolis, 
                   Minnesota. The name and taste derived from a then-popular 
                   malted milk drink (milkshake) of the day, not after the 
                   astronomical galaxy.[3][4]
                </p>

                    On March 10, 1925, the Milky Way trademark was registered in
                     the U.S., claiming a first-use date of 1922.[5] In 1924, 
                     the Milky Way bar was introduced nationally, with sales 
                     totalling $800,000 that year. The chocolate for the 
                     chocolate coating was supplied by Hershey's.[6]

                    By 1926, two variants were available: chocolate nougat with 
                    milk chocolate coating, and vanilla nougat with a dark 
                    chocolate coating, each selling for 5Â¢. In June 1932, the 
                    bar was marketed as a two-piece bar, and four years later, 
                    in 1936, the chocolate and vanilla were separated. The 
                    vanilla version with a dark chocolate coating was called 
                    "Forever Yours" and was marketed under this name until 1979,
                     then Milky Way Dark was reintroduced in 1989.[7] Later 
                     "Milky Way Dark" was renamed "Milky Way Midnight".[8]

                    In 1935, Mars used the marketing slogan "The sweet you can 
                    eat between meals,"[6] later using "At work, rest and play, 
                    you get three great tastes in a Milky Way." By 2006, Mars 
                    used the slogan "Comfort in every bar" in the U.S. and most 
                    recently "Life's better the Milky Way."[9]

                    In 2010, the Milky Way Simply Caramel bar went on sale, a 
                    version with caramel covered in milk chocolate and without 
                    nougat. In 2011, Mars introduced a small size (marketed as 
                    fun size) Simply Caramel bar. A salted caramel version has 
                    since been introduced. Milky Way Simply Caramel was 
                    discontinued in the summer of 2023.

                    In 2012, Milky Way Caramel Apple Minis went on sale as a 
                    limited offer for the Halloween season.

                    In late summer of 2018, Milky Way Fudge, which substitutes 
                    chocolate fudge nougat for malt nougat, was introduced 
                    nationwide.[10]

                    The American Milky Way bar has 240 calories in each 52.2 
                    gram bar; the Milky Way Midnight has 220 calories in each 50
                     gram bar; and the Milky Way Simply Caramel bar has 250 
                     calories in each 54 gram bar.[11]

                    In 2024, Mars and Jel Sert collaborated to market Milky 
                    Way-flavored pudding and pie mix.[12]

                    In November 2012, a new print and digital advertising 
                    campaign was launched in the U.S. called "Sorry, I was 
                    eating a Milky Way". The campaign portrayed the comical 
                    aftermath of what happens after someone (off camera) is 
                    distracted due to eating a Milky Way bar. This campaign 
                    originated from the suggestion that eating a Milky Way bar 
                    may be a slow, involved process.[13]

                    The version of the Milky Way bar sold outside the United 
                    States has no caramel topping; it consists of a nougat 
                    centre that is considerably less dense than that of the 
                    British Mars bar and the American Milky Way bar. Because of 
                    this low density (0.88 g/cm3), it floats in milk, an 
                    attribute highlighted in an advertising campaign in several 
                    European countries.[14]

                    In the UK, Mars introduced the Flyte bar, which was 
                    identical to the old-style chocolate flavored Milky Way, 
                    marketed in twin packs and discontinued in 2015. Also 
                    available in Europe are Milky Way Crispy Rolls, 
                    chocolate-covered wafer rolls with milk-cream fillings.

                    A variant of the Milky Way bar branded 'Milky Way Magic 
                    Stars', created by Barnaby Edwards, is marketed in the UK, 
                    with small aerated chocolate star shapes. Each star is 
                    engraved with a different smiley face, representing one of 
                    the "magic star" characters portrayed on the packaging and 
                    referenced in the advertising: Pop Star, Jess Star, Bright 
                    Star, Super Star, Twinkle Star, Falling Star, Happy Star, 
                    Sport Star, Clever Star and Baby Star. Subsequently, 
                    reference to the characters was dropped, the packaging 
                    since depicting blank stars, although the faces remain in 
                    the chocolates themselves. As of at least 2024 the faces 
                    have returned on the packaging for magic stars.

                    A long-running advertising slogan for the product in the 
                    United Kingdom and Australia was, "The sweet you can eat 
                    between meals without ruining your appetite".[15] In 1991, 
                    the Health Education Authority and anti-sugar lobbyists both
                     complained, without success, to the Independent Television 
                     Commission that such advertising encouraged children to eat
                      sweets between meals. The ITC agreed with Mars that its 
                      advertisements in fact encouraged restrained eating.[16]

                   Once marketed as a snack food that would not intrude on 
                   regular meals, modern marketing portrays the Milky Way as a 
                   snack reducing mealtime hunger and curbing the appetite 
                   between meals.[17] 
                </p>

                   A widely known advertisement was debuted in 1989, featuring a
                    red 1951 Buick Roadmaster and a vehicle that resembles a 
                    blue 1959 Cadillac Series 62 (lacking its dual headlights) 
                    racing, with the former eating everything in sight and the 
                    latter eating a Milky Way. The advertisement ends with the 
                    bridge to Dinnertown being out and the now fat red car being
                     too heavy to jump the gap while the blue car makes the 
                     jump. The advertisement returned albeit edited in 2009, 
                     removing the claim that the Milky Way is not an appetite 
                     spoiler.[18]
