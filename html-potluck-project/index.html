        <p>
            Brennan Huff <b>(Will Ferrell)</b> and Dale Doback 
            <b>(John C. Reilly)</b> have one
            thing in common: they are both lazy, unemployed leeches who still 
            live with their parents. When Brennan's mother and Dale's father 
            marry and move in together, it turns the overgrown boys' world 
            upside down. Their insane rivalry and narcissism pull the new 
            family apart, forcing them to work together to reunite their 
            parents.

            When John Bennett <b>(Mark Wahlberg)</b> was a little boy, he made a
            wish 
            that Ted <b>(Seth MacFarlane)</b>, his beloved teddy bear, would 
            come 
            alive. Thirty years later, foul-mouthed Ted is still John's constant
            companion, much to the chagrin of Lori <b>(Mila Kunis)</b>, John's 
            girlfriend. Though Lori's displeasure is exacerbated by the pair's 
            onstant consumption of beer and weed, she's not the one who's most 
            disappointed with John; it may take the intervention of John's 
            boyhood toy to help him grow up at last.

        <h4>Rated R, Released June 5, 2009</h4>
        <p>
            Two days before his wedding, Doug <b>(Justin Bartha)</b> and three 
            friends 
            <b>(Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis)</b> drive to 
            Las Vegas for
            a wild and memorable stag party. In fact, when the three groomsmen 
            wake up the next morning, they can't remember a thing; nor can they 
            find Doug. With little time to spare, the three hazy pals try to 
            re-trace their steps and find Doug so they can get him back to 
            Los Angeles in time to walk down the aisle.
