                <h1>NBA Finals Game 7 Preview</h1>
                <h5>by Tim Mailhoit, June 20th, 2025</h5>
                <img src="images/nba-finas.jpg" alt="finals">
                <p>
                    Every NBA playoff series at some point becomes an object 
                    lesson, a teachable moment, a chance to ask players, coaches
                    , and sometimes ourselves to look inward and ask, with a 
                    practiced earnestness, What have you learned?
                    The answer might be about the strength of the opponent. Or 
                    the difficulty of closing out a series. Or the importance of
                    preparation, of film study, of good work habits, of 
                    attention to detail. You win, you learn. You lose, you 
                    learn. More games just mean more lessons, more 
                    introspection, more discovery.
                    So here, dear NBA fans, is what we have now learned, through
                    six games of a taut 2025 NBA Finals between the Oklahoma 
                    City Thunder and Indiana Pacers, a series that will now go 
                    to a seventh game thanks to an unfathomable 108-91 rout by 
                    the Pacers on Thursday night: Nothing means anything.
                    Regular-season records? Meaningless. Odds and predictions? 
                    Oddly meaningless. Fancy advanced stats and data 
                    visualizations? Fancy and meaningless. MVP trophies? Shiny 
                    and meaningless. A serious leg injury that reportedly should
                    have sidelined the Pacers’ best player? Apparently, not 
                    serious enough to matter.
                    The Thunder seemingly had everything going for them heading
                     into these Finals—the talent, the depth, the defense, the 
                     gaudy win total (68), the Most Valuable Player 
                     (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander), even the longer rest before the 
                     series (eight days, compared to five for the Pacers). 
                     Oklahoma had been favored to win the West since the 
                     preseason, while the Pacers were favored to make the 
                     play-in tournament.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And on Sunday, they will both play 48 minutes (or, who knows
                    , maybe 53!) to decide who claims the Larry O’Brien Trophy. 
                    Because nothing means anything in the NBA of 2025. And this 
                    is a beautiful, glorious thing if you’re a fan of the game 
                    writ large (and not, say, a fan specifically of the Thunder,
                     who surely expected to be cradling good ol’ Larry by now).
                    If the great allure of sports is the drama, the suspense, 
                    and the wonder of what happens next, these Finals have 
                    overdelivered beyond all possible expectations. The Thunder 
                    had Game 1 in the bag … until Tyrese Haliburton hit that 
                    deep jumper with three-tenths of a second left. The Thunder 
                    still seemed poised to control the series … until the Pacers
                     roughed them up in Game 3. And after the Thunder handily 
                     took Games 4 (in Indiana) and 5 (in Oklahoma), they 
                     absolutely seemed primed to take the title in Game 6, 
                     especially given the doubts about Haliburton, who was 
                     dealing with a strained calf that, according to reports, 
                     would have kept him out of a less critical game. And then 
                     the Pacers thoroughly, shockingly obliterated them anyway, 
                     leading by as many as 31, with Haliburton at the front of 
                     the pack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe the lesson here is that the youthful Thunder—who just 
                    won their first playoff series together a year ago—still 
                    have lessons to learn about poise and focus and effort in a 
                    game of such gravity. But then, the Pacers are pretty young 
                    as well. The lessons should be offsetting.
                    So maybe the lesson is simply that, in this NBA age of 
                    profound parity, the talent differential between any two 
                    playoff teams is not necessarily as great as the stats and 
                    win-loss records would imply. That objects in the mirror are
                    closer than they appear. And in this case, that the Pacers,
                    despite 18 fewer wins in the regular season, one fewer MVP
                    , and way fewer accolades, are perhaps closer to the 
                    Thunder than anyone could have surmised when this series 
                    began 15 days ago.
                    Or perhaps the weight of winning the championship was simply
                    too great for a team still learning the lessons of June.
                    “Definitely in the back of our minds, for sure,” 
                    Gilgeous-Alexander conceded after the Game 6 loss. “Now, we 
                    didn’t play like it at all. That’s why the night went the 
                    way it did. We got exactly what we deserved.”
                </p>
                <img src="images/shai-vs-nemb.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Gilgeous-Alexander has been just as sleek and crafty as 
                    expected in these Finals, but also more error prone in 
                    critical moments, including a 21-point, eight-turnover 
                    performance in Game 6. Haliburton can’t match SGA’s stats or
                    skills, but he has matched his overall impact and his win 
                    total. Jalen Williams is a more potent and creative scorer 
                    than Pascal Siakam, but it’s Siakam who has been more 
                    efficient in this series. For every Chet Holmgren highlight
                    for the Thunder, the Pacers have countered with a T.J. 
                    McConnell burst. For every Lu Dort explosion, Indiana has 
                    countered with a Bennedict Mathurin moment.
                    All told, OKC leads the Pacers by just seven total points 
                    across six games—enough to underscore the Thunder’s 
                    perceived superiority, but not enough to decide the 
                    championship after two weeks of basketball.
                    “It’s special now, to be creating our own run,” Haliburton 
                    said. “It’s a lot of fun, and obviously to win a 
                    championship would mean the world to me. But we’re not there
                    yet.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we go to a Game 7, where the Thunder will look to finally
                    validate eight months of dominance and the Pacers will look
                    to complete one of the great upsets in NBA Finals history.
                    The last team to win the championship with 50 wins or 
                    fewer (in an 82-game regular season) was the 1994-95 
                    Houston Rockets, who’d won 47.
                    But then again, this entire postseason has been a testament 
                    to the Pacers’ uncanny resolve, their ability to wipe out 
                    20-point deficits, to meet every moment, to hit every clutch
                    shot, to defy expectations again and again and again. The 
                    Pacers weren’t supposed to be here—not in the Eastern 
                    Conference finals or the NBA Finals, and definitely not a 
                    decisive Game 7. 
                    But a Game 7 there will be, Sunday night in Oklahoma City, 
                    where the Thunder will surely be favored once more, the 
                    Pacers will try to defy expectations once more, and the rest
                    of us will relish the tension and the fireworks once more, 
                    until a champion is finally crowned.
                    “One game for everything you ever dreamed of,” 
                    Gilgeous-Alexander said. “If you win it, you get everything.
                    If you lose it, you get nothing. It’s that simple.”
                    Someone will at long last raise the Larry O’Brien Trophy on 
                    Sunday night, but there’s no guarantee what lessons will be 
                    learned, save one: In the NBA Finals, suspense is better 
                    than certainty. No one foresaw a Finals like this. And 
                    that’s a damn good thing.End of article

                <h3>Potential Finals MVP</h3>
                <img src="images/mvp.jpeg" alt="mvp">
                <p>
                    The 2025 NBA Finals are going the distance, and the NBA 
                    Finals MVP market is as close as it's been all series long 
                    ahead of Sunday’s Game 7.
                    Shai Gilgeous-Alexander remains the favorite to win the 
                    award at -220, but the Oklahoma City Thunder’s loss in Game 
                    6 to the Indiana Pacers has shifted the series odds from 
                    OKC -1600 to OKC -325.So, Shai has come crashing down in 
                    terms of his lead in this market, and there are four 
                    players at 12/1 or less that can win this award, including
                    Pacers forward Pascal Siakam, who skyrocketed to the No. 2 
                    choice in the market after Game 6. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While oddsmakers seem to think that SGA still should win 
                    this award – if OKC wins Game 7 – it’s hard not to see some
                    value in Siakam and Haliburton in this market.
                    The Pacers already have 10 outright wins as underdogs this 
                    postseason, and Siakam has been the driving force for 
                    Indiana as of late with Haliburton hampered by a calf 
                    injury. While I think there is some value in Haliburton, 
                    it’s worth noting that Siakam was north of 10/1 prior to 
                    Game 6 before coming down to +390 after the Pacers picked 
                    up a win.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Siakam is averaging 19.8 points, 8.3 rebounds, 4.0 assists 
                    and 1.7 steals per game in the Finals, and while he hasn’t 
                    had any dominant scoring games, he’s been by far the most 
                    consistent player for the Pacers.
                    After winning Eastern Conference Finals MVP, Siakam has a 
                    real case to win Finals MVP as well, and he could be worth 
                    a shot at +390 for bettors that believe the Pacers have one 
                    more upset in them.
                    On the Thunder side, there certainly is some value in Jalen 
                    Williams (+1000) to win Finals MVP. Williams had a 40-point 
                    game in Game 5, and he’s arguably outplayed SGA in multiple 
                    games in this series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Williams has the signature performance in Game 7, it 
                    could swing this market in his favor, and 10/1 is a pretty 
                    juicy price to get him at.
                    The Thunder are still heavily favored to win this series in 
                    Game 7, but it’s clear that the Finals MVP market is 
                    adjusting in case the Pacers do win. Prior to Game 6, SGA 
                    and Williams were the two favorites in this market with no 
                    other player set at shorter than 10/1 odds.
